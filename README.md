# DSSC - Algorithmic Design  -  Homework 02

27/05/2020

Dear Prof. Casagrande,

This is supposed to be the first README you read.

As an effort to produce an ordered set of homeworks I will try my best to add the most complete README files for each folder. Each folder will contain one of the exercises on the homework. The content will be restrained to the solution of the homework, the git backstory will be of course accessible, but it might be not very complete before this date. Only now my efforts for a clear archiviation have started, and so from now on I will try to create a complete git backlog.
My hope is to finish them by ten days before the first exam(17/06/2020). I really thank you for having delayed the deadline.

I also hope that you will have time to give a glance to the README files I produce.

Cordially,

Nicola Domenis
